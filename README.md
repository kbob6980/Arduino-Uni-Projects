# Arduino-Uni-Projects
Simple Arduino projects completed as part of an IoT module in my Master's program.\
The code may not be pretty, but it gets the job done!

## [Arduino Seven_Segment_Display](https://github.com/kbob6980/Arduino-Uni-Projects/tree/main/Seven_Segment_Display)
2 simple projects done with a seven-segment display.\
The first one is a 0-9 counting loop.\
The second one is a simple "flowing" shapes loop.\
Built and simulated in Tinkercad.\
